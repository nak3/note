### Catalan Number

Catalan numbers is a sequence of natural numbers that occur in various counting problems.

which is a solution of this recurrence formula.

The first catalan numbers for n = 0,1,2,3,... are

```
1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429 ...
```

the sequence form such as:

- The number of a convex polygon with n+2 sides, which can be cut into triangles by connecting vertices with non-crossing line segments.
- The number of ways to tile a stair step of height n with n rectangles.
- The number of tournament games by n+1 people in total.

### Euler's totient function

Euler's totient function is the number of integers from 0 to N that are relatively prime to n.

### Extended Euclidean algorithm

```
ax + by = gcd(a, b)
```

Integers x and y are always exist and calculable. Extended Euclidean algorithm can calcurate them.

e.g
```
41x + 28y = 1 then x=-12,y=17
```
